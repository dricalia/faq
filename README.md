# faq-frontend-mentor

This is a solution to the accordion challenge FAQ developed in HTML and CSS for the front-end mentor.


## The Challenge:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Bonus: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript!

## What I learned 

In this project, have the opportunity to create an accordian using the checkbox, learn more about image placement, spacing and hierarchy between objects. I was also able to apply my first animation and learned by mistake that it is better to start with mobile first.
